abstract: This study seeks to calculate the area that specific crops cover in a given area of interest. The authors ' focus is on obtaining the required level of classification accuracy to support governmental authorities in managing food security requirements and strategic planning. In order to create a multi-class classification pipeline that goes from image acquisition all the way through inference, optical satellite imagery is combined with ensemble machine learning models like Random forest, which have shown to be a good fit for such cases. In this study, the Near Infrared, Red, Green, and Blue spectral bands of the Sentinel-2 satellite are stacked for classification. Overall, Random Forest' s categorization accuracy using Sentinel-2 imagery is 89.22%. A 2.4 KM2 random sample size and 385 samples are used to generalize this accuracy to the state of El Gaziera, producing a 95% confidence interval and a 5% margin of error.
