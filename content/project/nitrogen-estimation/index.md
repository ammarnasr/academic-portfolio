title: Nitrogen Estimation Tool
summary: This tool helps you estimate the amount of nitrogen fertilizer needed for your field based on the crop type, soil type, expected yield and the most recent satellite imagery of your field. The estimation is based on mathematical models developed by the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA) and calibrated for the Sudanese conditions.
