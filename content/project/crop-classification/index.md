title: Crop Classification
summary: Crop Classification using Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning based on the AmunData 50,000Km2 dataset across the Sudan states for the years 2019 and 2020. I use time series features extracted from the satellite imagery using the Google Earth Engine API and machine learning to classify the crop type. The model achieves an average accuracy of 90% across the different states and  6 crops (Sorghum, Groundnut, Sesame, Cotton, Wheat, and Millet)

DataQ and AmunData are working on country wide research to lay the grounds for a healthy investment in the sector. The research will use cutting edge technology from data collection and analysis.
The research aims to:
- Identify the size of the local and global markets and the market trends for the past five years.
- Identifying the key internal drivers and restraints.
- Identifying market gaps and opportunities.
*Targeted crops: sesame, sorghum, cotton, Groundnuts, Millet, Sunflower
